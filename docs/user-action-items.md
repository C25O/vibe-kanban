# Required Actions from User

## Immediate Decisions Needed (Before Phase 1)

### 1. Technology Stack Choices
**Decision Required**: Choose UI library for RefineDev
- **Options**: 
  - Ant Design (Enterprise-focused, comprehensive components)
  - Material UI (Google Material Design, modern)
  - Tailwind CSS (Utility-first, maximum customization)
- **Recommendation**: Ant Design (best for business applications)
- **Timeline**: Needed before development starts

### FEEDBACK (1)
```
Use Ant Design.
```

### 2. Backend Service Selection
**Decision Required**: Choose backend/database solution
- **Options**:
  - REST API with existing backend
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL with real-time features)
  - Firebase (Google's platform)
  - Strapi (Headless CMS)
  - Custom GraphQL API
- **Recommendation**: Supabase (best for kanban features + RefineDev integration)
- **Timeline**: Needed before Phase 1
  
### FEEDBACK (2)
```
Use Supabase for BACKEND (Also for OAUTH, although this might change in the future for something like WorkOS).

# REMOTE SERVICE CONNECTION
# FILE: env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL={AS PER THE LOCAL ENV FILE}
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY={AS PER THE LOCAL ENV FILE}

```

### 3. Project Requirements Specification
**Action Required**: Provide detailed project requirements
- Target user personas and use cases
- Required features priority list
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Security and compliance needs
- **Timeline**: Before Phase 1 starts

### FEEDBACK (3)
```
I instructed the team to share the requested material.
```


## Phase 1 Requirements (Project Setup)

### 4. Development Environment Access
**Actions Required**:
- [x] Provide access to chosen backend service
- [x] Set up development database
- [ ] Configure authentication provider (OAuth, etc.)
- [ ] Provide API keys and credentials
- **Timeline**: During Phase 1 setup

### FEEDBACK (4)
```
Use the file .env.local for connection evironment variable.
Use Supabase to configure AUTH
```


### 5. Design Requirements
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Provide brand guidelines (colors, fonts, logo)
- [ ] Share any existing design mockups or wireframes
- [ ] Define responsive design requirements
- [ ] Specify accessibility requirements
- **Timeline**: Before Phase 2

### FEEDBACK (5)
```
I instructed the team to share the requested material.
```


## Phase 2 Requirements (Core Features)

### 6. Business Logic Decisions
**Decisions Required**:
- User roles and permission structure
- Workflow customization requirements
- Data retention and backup policies
- Integration requirements with existing tools
- **Timeline**: During Phase 2 planning

### 7. Content and Copy
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Provide application copy and messaging
- [ ] Define error messages and notifications

- **Timeline**: During Phase 2 development

## Phase 3 Requirements (Advanced Features)

### 8. Integration Specifications
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Define third-party integrations needed
- [ ] Provide API documentation for integrations
- [ ] Specify real-time feature requirements
- [ ] Define notification preferences and channels
- **Timeline**: Before Phase 3

## Phase 4 Requirements (Deployment)

### 9. Production Environment
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Set up production hosting environment
- [ ] Configure domain and SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging services
- [ ] Prepare production database
- **Timeline**: During Phase 4

### 10. Go-Live Planning
**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Plan user migration strategy (if applicable)
- [ ] Prepare user training materials
- [ ] Define success metrics and KPIs
- [ ] Plan post-launch support structure
- **Timeline**: Phase 4 completion

## Critical Path Items (Blocking Development)

### High Priority (Must Have Before Starting)
1. ✅ UI Library choice (Ant Design recommended)
2. ✅ Backend service selection (Supabase recommended)
3. ✅ Basic project requirements document

### Medium Priority (Needed During Development)
4. Brand guidelines and design requirements
5. Detailed feature specifications
6. Development environment access

### Lower Priority (Can Be Provided Later)
7. Advanced integration requirements
8. Production deployment details
9. User training materials

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Make technology stack decisions (#1, #2)
2. **This Week**: Provide project requirements (#3)
3. **Before Development**: Complete design requirements (#5)
